# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
 This project involves predicting house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. I used data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. For model training, I implemented Linear Regression to predict house prices based on factors like area, location, number of bedrooms, and availability. The model was evaluated using metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error to assess its performance. Visualizations were also created to showcase the relationship between features and house prices.
